## 1. Test for dissolved oxygen
## 1a.

Cumulative area of test statistic=-2.85
p-value=0.0044

## 1b.

The conclusion is that the significant p-value in the context is less than 0.02 which is 0.0046, so the null hypothesis is rejected at 2% level of significance. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the population mean dissolved oxygen content is different from 10. The result is statistically significant.
