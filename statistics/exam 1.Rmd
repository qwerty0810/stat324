If the district were to collect many random samples of size 20, about 99% of those intervals would contain the district third-grade population mean score.

Decreasing the confidence level from 99% to 90% and calculating the interval again would yield a narrower interval.

If the sample mean is not in the center 99% of the distribution of sample means (for n=20), then the interval does not contain the population mean.
