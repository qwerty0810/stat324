## 1. Skin wounds
## 1a.

```{r}
x=c(29,27,34,40,22,28,14,35,26,35,12,30,23,18,11,22,23,33)

qqnorm(x)
qqline(x,col="blue")
```
From thw above plot, we can say that the population distribution is normal since the points are close to the central line.



## 1b.
25.66±3.227
(22.254,29.808)

## 1c.

W dont reject H0 as 25 is in 90% interval

## 1d.

P-Value =0.3670114

P-value=0.367>α=0.05
so the data is not a strong evidnece of mean rate being less than 25

## 1e.

The correct options are:
ii. Replace t17,.05 with z.05 = 1.645.
iv. Replace s (calculated from the data) with σ = 8.


## 2. Test and power
## 2a.

p-Value = 0.1877
Conclusion: p-value>α=0.10
Do not reject null hypothesis


## 2b.

α=0.10(since we dont reject null hypothesis)
so it is plausible that 12 is in 90% interval

## 2c.

power = 1 - ß = 0.6178
